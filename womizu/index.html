              EXPLORE THE LIFE MAP OF YOUR SECRET NUMBERS</p>
            <p>
              The roots of the life code trace back to ancient Western mysticism, originating from the number theory pioneered by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras over 2500 years ago. Pythagoras, renowned as the father of mathematical geometry, introduced this concept. He famously proclaimed, 'Numbers are the principle of all things, starting from the foundation.' Pythagoras firmly believed that numbers transcended mere measurements; they possessed inherent energy and frequency. In his view, numbers could manifest in various forms such as music or heat energy in everyday life. Just as music can evoke emotions, numbers, according to Pythagoras, held the power to directly influence people's lives.

                  Order leads to stability, and they pay special attention to order, rules, logic, and facts. Therefore, they are born with the ability to make things safer and more stable, and are good planners, organizers and keepers. The instability brought about by change makes them feel deeply insecure, and finding a sense of security is their ultimate task. On the one hand, they are uneasy about the status quo and want new ideas for career and life. On the other hand, they are very conservative and tend to seek a balance between rationality and sensibility in order to avoid any discomfort with their own security. But once they find a breakthrough in a certain link and determine that the risk factor is not high, they will hold on and go all out, and will not give up until they achieve their goal. However, precisely because number 4 represents stability and security, people with the number 4 personality lack imagination. They always put the key points and facts out when they speak and do things. However, we know that if you pay too much attention to facts, you will inevitably offend others unintentionally. Facts are actually something that many people avoid.
