It is advised for them to be cautious with financial matters; otherwise, they may overspend, leading to financial difficulties. As their optimal life state is in their later years, it is recommended for individuals like them to accumulate assets and invest in properties such as real estate and intellectual property during their middle age.

There may be better and greater opportunities for wealth in the future.",

However, when comparing themselves to others in their youth, they may feel that others achieve wealth more easily and believe they need to work harder. Therefore, it is crucial for them to learn perseverance, as their best life stage is in their later years.

In their later years, they may feel the urge to start a new business or invest again, but they'll notice that despite having experience, their physical strength and energy can't match those of younger individuals. Therefore, it is recommended for individuals like this to change to a more powerful social circle and learn to leverage the strengths of others, especially in the Wood Year.",

Simultaneously, they should focus on self-improvement, acquiring new skills, as their ability is crucial, especially since hired employees may not appreciate their leadership.

However, they lack practical action and execution abilities, leaning towards communication, conceptualization, and proposing ideas. They prefer to delegate execution to others. An overly cynical personality becomes their rationalization, causing them to stagnate. Idealists relish in the first experience, favoring brands, easily giving others a showy impression. Typically, the outer appearance of idealists may give the impression of great wealth, but in reality, it may not be as affluent as imagined. In terms of financial investment, they tend to create a facade to maximize current benefits. Therefore, they are not in a hurry to acquire heavy assets during the entrepreneurial phase but are inclined to engage in various other investments. In the world of love, they crave surprises, pursue romance, and are particular about how celebrations unfold. If you cannot meet their emotional needs, the future may become tumultuous.

This results in employees needing constant approval from them, causing delays in progress. Therefore, it is recommended that pragmatic bosses create financial budgets and employee manuals.

They are usually busy exploring new markets, willing to enter various social circles, and easily establishing good relationships. Therefore, they have a broader network of resources. They know how to enjoy life and can achieve a good balance between ideals and materialism, often living as winners. In terms of investments, they consider the overall cost and future development space. They may purchase remote factories and land beneficial for subsequent expansion and development. Often, these forward-looking investments have the opportunity for greater appreciation in the future and yield larger returns. In love, visionaries pursue both bread and love. They are busy realizing their dreams in their youth, having no time to experience the nuances of love, usually dealing with mundane aspects of life.
